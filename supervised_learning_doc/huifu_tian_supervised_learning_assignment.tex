In this assignment, the datasets I will be using are the Polish bankruptcy dataset and the MNIST dataset to compare various supervised learning algorithms.

The Polish bankruptcy dataset is a collection of public Polish companies that went bankrupt spanning 2000-2012 and solvent companies spanning 2007-2013.
